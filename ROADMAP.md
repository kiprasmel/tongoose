# Roadmap

[Back to Table of Contents](https://github.com/tongoose/tongoose#table-of-contents)

## The Map

- back up the previous index.d.ts file if any exist in the target directory BEFORE wiping it and creating the new one :D

- figure out how to convert mongoose's (or not mongoose's) `Map`, `Mixed`, `Buffer` types to typescript (currently setting them to `any`)

- take care of all the mongoose types @ https://mongoosejs.com/docs/schematypes.html

- yargs manager file

- no output to `.tongoose` directory option & implementation

- fix `#copyFix` - `index.d.ts` file backing up into `.tongoose/type-defs/` folder

- `--watch` option

- auto tool for debugging the `.replace(regex)` parser lol

- release v1.0.0
